# Maw — Intent-Compiled Private DeFi Agent

You type "60/40 ETH/USDC, $200/day, 7 days." The agent compiles that into scoped on-chain permissions, reasons privately about when to trade via Venice AI, executes swaps on Uniswap within those limits, and records every decision to an ERC-8004 reputation registry — fully autonomous, fully auditable.

## What Is Maw?

DeFi users who want autonomous portfolio management face a dilemma: either trust an agent with full wallet access, or micromanage every trade. Every time an agent calls an API or executes a swap, it creates metadata — spending patterns, risk tolerance, portfolio value. The agent isn't leaking its own data; it's leaking yours.

Maw resolves this by compiling a natural language intent — like *"60/40 ETH/USDC, $200/day, 7 days"* — into granular, scoped [ERC-7715](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7715) permissions that the agent **cannot violate**, even if compromised. The human defines boundaries (amount limits, time windows, token-specific allowances) and the agent operates freely within them on-chain via [ERC-7710](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7710) delegation redemption — without repeated user signatures.

The agent reasons privately about *when* to trade (Venice AI — no data retention, E2EE, TEE-capable models), but its *ability* to trade is constrained by on-chain periodic-transfer enforcers. Every swap gets scored by an LLM judge across three dimensions, recorded on-chain via [ERC-8004](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8004) with content-addressed evidence, and those scores feed back into the next cycle's reasoning prompt — so the agent actually gets better over time.

## How It Works

### Intent Lifecycle

    User->>Dashboard: "60/40 ETH/USDC, $200/day, 7 days"
    Dashboard->>Venice: Parse intent (structured output)

    MM-->>Dashboard: { context, delegationManager, dependencies }

        Agent->>Chain: Read portfolio balances (viem RPC)
        Agent->>CMC: Fetch ETH price
        Agent->>Agent: Calculate allocation drift

        alt Drift exceeds threshold
            Agent->>Venice: "Should I rebalance?" (private reasoning)
            Venice-->>Agent: { shouldRebalance, reasoning, targetSwap }

            alt Rebalance approved
                Note over Agent,MM: ERC-7710 Token Pull (server-side)
                Agent->>MM: Check period allowance remaining
                Agent->>MM: pullNativeToken() or pullErc20Token()
                MM->>Chain: sendTransactionWithDelegation()
                Chain-->>Agent: Tokens arrive at agent EOA

                Agent->>Uniswap: Get quote + Permit2 data
                Uniswap-->>Agent: Quote with route
                Agent->>Chain: Execute swap from agent EOA
                Chain-->>Agent: Transaction receipt
            end
        end
    end
```

The key architectural choice is two-step pull+swap: ERC-7710 pulls tokens from the user's smart account to the agent's EOA, then the agent swaps directly on Uniswap. This separation exists because `native-token-periodic` permissions restrict delegated calls to plain transfers — the agent can't call Uniswap through the delegation. Venice reasoning runs with no-data-retention and E2EE so the LLM never learns your portfolio strategy. After the initial MetaMask approval, the loop runs autonomously — no further user signatures needed.

### Post-Swap Evaluation

After every swap, a separate judge pipeline scores the agent's performance and writes the results on-chain:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Agent as Agent Wallet
    participant Evidence as Evidence Store
    participant Judge as Venice LLM Judge
    participant JudgeWallet as Judge Wallet
    participant ValReg as Validation<br/>Registry
    participant RepReg as Reputation<br/>Registry

    Note over Agent,RepReg: ERC-8004 Three-Registry Pipeline

    Agent->>Evidence: Build swap evidence document<br/>(intent, before/after state, execution details)
    Evidence-->>Agent: Content-addressed hash + URL

    Agent->>ValReg: validationRequest(agentId, judgeAddr, evidenceURI, hash)

    Agent->>Judge: Evaluate evidence across 3 dimensions
    Note right of Judge: decision-quality (was the trade warranted?)<br/>execution-quality (gas, slippage, delegation use)<br/>goal-progress (did drift improve?)

    Judge-->>Agent: Calibrated scores (0-100) + reasoning

    loop For each dimension
        JudgeWallet->>Evidence: Store response document
        JudgeWallet->>ValReg: validationResponse(requestHash, score, responseURI)
    end

    JudgeWallet->>Evidence: Store composite feedback document
    JudgeWallet->>RepReg: giveFeedback(agentId, compositeScore, feedbackURI, feedbackHash)
```

This isn't just scoring — it's a closed loop. Scores feed back into the next cycle's reasoning prompt as "PAST PERFORMANCE FEEDBACK," so the agent self-corrects: low execution quality steers toward smaller trades, low goal progress triggers reconsidered direction. All evidence is content-addressed with keccak256 (on-chain hash must match hosted JSON), and the judge wallet is architecturally separate from the agent wallet — designed to support external judges, currently operated by the same party with an LLM prompt tuned for calibrated evaluation.

## Sponsor Integrations

Maw's design is built around the cross-integration of four sponsor technologies. A single intent flows through all four in sequence: Venice parses it, MetaMask constrains it, Uniswap executes it, and Protocol Labs records it.

### Venice AI — "Private Agents, Trusted Actions"

Venice provides the agent's intelligence layer with a critical guarantee: **no data retention**, **end-to-end encryption** (E2EE), and **TEE-capable model inference**. Every LLM call is stateless — no session aggregation, no cross-request correlation, no training on queries. Prompts are encrypted at the client, routed through Venice's infrastructure without persistence, and purged from GPU memory after inference. The agent reasons over sensitive data privately, producing trustworthy outputs for public on-chain systems.

Over a 7-day trading window, the agent makes thousands of LLM calls — price checks, drift calculations, rebalance decisions, judge evaluations. Individually they're harmless. In aggregate, they're a complete map of someone's portfolio value, risk tolerance, and trading patterns. Venice's no-retention architecture means none of that persists on their side. The validated outputs (parsed intents, swap parameters, judge scores) go on-chain; the reasoning behind them stays in the agent's local logs.

**How Maw uses Venice** (implementation: [`venice/llm.ts`](packages/agent/src/venice/llm.ts), [`venice/schemas.ts`](packages/agent/src/venice/schemas.ts)):

| Capability | Integration | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Multi-model routing** | 2 models, 3 LLM tiers via single API | `qwen3-5-9b` (fast checks + research with web search), `gemini-3-flash-preview` (reasoning) — auto-downgrades when Venice balance is low |
| **Web search + scraping** | Research tier with real-time data | Research tier enables `enable_web_search: "on"` + `enable_web_scraping: true` with citations; used for market analysis context |
| **Structured output** | Intent parsing, rebalance decisions, judge scoring | `.withStructuredOutput(zodSchema)` with `safeParse()` post-validation on every call |
| **Privacy guarantees** | No-retention inference with E2EE and TEE | `include_venice_system_prompt: false`, `enable_e2ee: true` on all LLM tiers; TEE-capable models for confidential inference; prompt caching per tier |
| **Budget tracking** | Compute cost awareness | Custom fetch wrapper in [`logging/budget.ts`](packages/agent/src/logging/budget.ts) captures `x-venice-balance-usd` header; agent switches to cheaper models automatically |
| **LLM-as-judge** | Swap quality evaluation | Venice reasoning model in [`identity/judge.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/judge.ts) scores each swap across 3 dimensions for ERC-8004 reputation |
| **Image generation** | Per-agent avatar | Two-step in [`venice/image.ts`](packages/agent/src/venice/image.ts): LLM generates creative prompt → Venice image API (`nano-banana-2`) renders unique agent avatar, served at `/api/intents/:id/avatar.webp` |

### MetaMask — "Best Use of Delegations"

Delegations are not a feature of Maw — **intent-based delegations are the core pattern**. The human defines granular, scoped permissions once via MetaMask Flask, and the agent operates freely within them on-chain without repeated user signatures. Periodic-transfer caveat enforcers limit every pull to a per-period budget; the agent cannot escape its on-chain cage even if compromised.

This is a novel, creative use of delegations: natural language → LLM parsing → scoped ERC-7715 permissions → autonomous ERC-7710 execution, with pre-pull on-chain allowance verification, adversarial intent detection (flags dangerous configs before delegation creation), and human-readable audit reports showing exactly what the agent can and cannot do.

**How the delegation pipeline works:**

1. **Intent compilation** — Venice LLM parses "60/40 ETH/USDC, $200/day, 7 days" into structured parameters (target allocation, budget, slippage, time window) via [compiler.ts](packages/agent/src/delegation/compiler.ts)
2. **ERC-7715 permission grant (browser-side)** — Dashboard extends the wallet client with `erc7715ProviderActions()` from `@metamask/smart-accounts-kit`. Calls `requestExecutionPermissions()` in MetaMask Flask with `native-token-periodic` (ETH) and `erc20-token-periodic` (USDC) permission types. Period: 24 hours. Amount: daily budget converted via conservative ETH pricing. Returns `{ context, delegationManager, dependencies }`. See [use-permissions.ts](apps/dashboard/hooks/use-permissions.ts).
3. **Allowance checking** — Before each pull, the agent queries remaining period budget on-chain via `createCaveatEnforcerClient()` + `decodeDelegations()`. Methods: `getNativeTokenPeriodTransferEnforcerAvailableAmount()` and `getErc20PeriodTransferEnforcerAvailableAmount()`. See [allowance.ts](packages/agent/src/delegation/allowance.ts).
4. **ERC-7710 token pull (server-side)** — Agent uses `erc7710WalletActions()` to call `sendTransactionWithDelegation()`, pulling tokens from the user's smart account to the agent EOA. See [redeemer.ts](packages/agent/src/delegation/redeemer.ts).
5. **Direct swap** — Agent swaps from its own EOA on Uniswap. The pull+swap separation exists because `native-token-periodic` includes an `ExactCalldataEnforcer("0x")` that restricts delegated calls to plain ETH transfers only.
6. **Audit report** — Before execution begins, the system generates a human-readable report: what the agent is ALLOWED to do, what it's PREVENTED from doing, the WORST CASE scenario, and any WARNINGS. See [audit.ts](packages/agent/src/delegation/audit.ts).
7. **Adversarial intent detection** — Before delegation creation, `detectAdversarialIntent()` flags dangerous configs (budget > $1K, slippage > 2%, window > 30d). See [compiler.ts](packages/agent/src/delegation/compiler.ts) and [@maw/common delegation](packages/common/src/delegation.ts).

### Uniswap — "Agentic Finance"

Uniswap is Maw's agentic finance execution layer — real Dev Platform API key, real TxIDs on Sepolia, deeper stack usage with Permit2 and The Graph. The agent autonomously quotes, signs, and executes swaps with no human in the loop.

**Integration points:**

| Component | What It Does | Code |
|---|---|---|
| **Trading API (quote)** | Fetches optimal swap routes with configurable slippage; forces V3 routing on Sepolia | `getQuote()` in [uniswap/trading.ts](packages/agent/src/uniswap/trading.ts) |
| **Trading API (swap)** | Creates executable swap transactions | `createSwap()` in [uniswap/trading.ts](packages/agent/src/uniswap/trading.ts) |
| **Permit2** | EIP-712 typed data signing for gasless ERC-20 approvals | `signPermit2Data()` in [uniswap/permit2.ts](packages/agent/src/uniswap/permit2.ts) |
| **Approval check** | Queries whether Permit2 allowance exists before each swap | `checkApproval()` in [uniswap/trading.ts](packages/agent/src/uniswap/trading.ts) |
| **The Graph** | Fetches top WETH/USDC Uniswap V3 pools by TVL — fed into LLM reasoning prompt with liquidity guidance | `getPoolData()` in [data/thegraph.ts](packages/agent/src/data/thegraph.ts) |

The agent uses The Graph pool data to make liquidity-aware decisions. When the reasoning LLM considers a rebalance, it sees TVL, 24h volume, and fee tiers for the top pools, with explicit guidance about when swap size relative to pool TVL suggests splitting across cycles.

**Real swap TxIDs on Ethereum Sepolia** (125+ swaps executed autonomously, $5K+ total volume):

### Protocol Labs — "Let the Agent Cook" + "Agents With Receipts"

ERC-8004 gives the agent a portable identity on Ethereum and a reputation that follows it across platforms. Each intent gets its own NFT registration. Every swap is evaluated by the LLM judge, and the scores go on-chain across three registries (identity, validation, reputation) with content-addressed evidence. The agent runs fully autonomously — market data gathering, drift calculation, private reasoning, swap execution, judge evaluation, on-chain receipt submission — and self-corrects when things fail. All of it is viewable on [8004scan](https://testnet.8004scan.io).

**Three-registry architecture on Base Sepolia** (implementation: [`identity/erc8004.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/erc8004.ts)):

| Registry | Purpose | Wallet | Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[Identity Registry](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x8004A818BFB912233c491871b3d84c89A494BD9e)** | Per-intent NFT registration. Each intent gets its own `agentId`, persisted in SQLite across restarts. | Agent wallet | `registerAgent()` |
| **[Validation Registry](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x8004Cb1BF31DAf7788923b405b754f57acEB4272)** | Per-swap evidence chain. Agent submits a `validationRequest` with content-addressed evidence; judge wallet responds with scores per dimension. | Agent (request), Judge (responses) | `submitValidationRequest()`, `submitValidationResponse()` |
| **[Reputation Registry](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x8004B663056A597Dffe9eCcC1965A193B7388713)** | Composite swap quality score. `giveFeedback` with a weighted 0-10 score, linked to a content-addressed feedback document. | Judge wallet | `giveFeedback()` |

**Scoring dimensions** (implementation: [`identity/dimensions.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/dimensions.ts), extensible per intent type):

- **Decision quality** (weight 0.4) — Was the rebalance warranted? Was the trade size appropriate given drift and budget?
- **Execution quality** (weight 0.3) — Gas efficiency, slippage, delegation usage (preferred over direct tx)
- **Goal progress** (weight 0.3) — Did the swap move the portfolio closer to the target allocation?

**Venice LLM judge + feedback loop** ([`identity/judge.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/judge.ts), [`agent-loop/index.ts`](packages/agent/src/agent-loop/index.ts)) — After each swap, `evaluateSwap()` orchestrates the full pipeline: build evidence → store content-addressed JSON → submit on-chain validation request (agent wallet) → LLM scores across 3 dimensions → submit 3 on-chain validation responses (judge wallet) → compute weighted composite → submit on-chain reputation feedback (judge wallet) → **persist scores to database → inject last 5 evaluations into the next cycle's reasoning prompt**. The agent actively learns from its judge history: low execution quality triggers smaller trades, low goal progress triggers strategy reconsideration. The reputation registry enforces wallet-level separation — `giveFeedback` reverts if called from the agent's own address. **115 judge evaluations completed, 502 evidence documents hosted.**

**Evidence system** ([`identity/evidence.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/evidence.ts)) — Content-addressed JSON hosted at `https://api.maw.finance/api/evidence/{intentId}/{hash}`. The on-chain keccak256 hash must match the hosted content, making post-hoc tampering detectable. Evidence documents include before/after portfolio state, execution details, and agent reasoning.

**Live agent on 8004scan:** [Agent #2733 on testnet.8004scan.io](https://testnet.8004scan.io/agents/base-sepolia/2733) — identity, reputation scores, and validation history viewable in the ERC-8004 explorer. The dashboard links directly to 8004scan per-agent pages, and the [`identity.json` endpoint](packages/agent/src/routes/identity.ts) follows the [8004scan metadata parsing format](https://best-practices.8004scan.io/docs/implementation/agent-metadata-parsing).

## Hackathon Themes

Maw solves a real problem, not a checklist. One intent flows through all four sponsor technologies in sequence: Venice parses it privately, MetaMask constrains it on-chain, Uniswap executes it, and Protocol Labs records it with verifiable receipts. The human stays in control — the agent is the tool.

### Agents That Keep Secrets

*Your LLM provider shouldn't know your portfolio.*

The agent makes thousands of LLM calls over a trading window. Venice's no-data-retention inference with E2EE and TEE-capable models means none of that reasoning persists outside the agent's local logs. The strategy stays private; only the execution receipts go on-chain.

**How Maw keeps secrets:**

| Capability | Implementation | Code |
|---|---|---|
| No-retention inference | All LLM calls stateless, no session aggregation, no training on queries | [`venice/llm.ts`](packages/agent/src/venice/llm.ts) — `include_venice_system_prompt: false` |
| End-to-end encryption | `enable_e2ee: true` on all three LLM tiers (fast, research, reasoning) | [`venice/llm.ts`](packages/agent/src/venice/llm.ts) — `baseVeniceParams` |
| TEE-capable models | Inference on TEE-capable models (`qwen3-5-9b`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`) | [`venice/llm.ts`](packages/agent/src/venice/llm.ts) — model selection |
| Human-controlled disclosure | Strategy stays in local logs; only validated outputs go on-chain | [`logging/intent-log.ts`](packages/agent/src/logging/intent-log.ts), [`logging/redact.ts`](packages/agent/src/logging/redact.ts) |
| Log redaction | Public-facing log endpoints strip sensitive reasoning from SSE streams | [`logging/redact.ts`](packages/agent/src/logging/redact.ts) |

**Sponsor alignment:** Venice — "Private Agents, Trusted Actions"

### Agents That Pay

*One approval, then the agent handles the money.*

Natural language intents get compiled into ERC-7715 periodic-transfer permissions via MetaMask Flask. The agent pulls tokens via ERC-7710 delegation redemption and swaps on Uniswap, constrained by on-chain caveat enforcers that cap per-period budgets. Every tx is on-chain — you can inspect exactly what the agent did after the fact.

**How Maw pays:**

| Capability | Implementation | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Scoped spending permissions | ERC-7715 `native-token-periodic` + `erc20-token-periodic` with 24h period budgets | [`hooks/use-permissions.ts`](apps/dashboard/hooks/use-permissions.ts) |
| Autonomous token pull | ERC-7710 `sendTransactionWithDelegation()` pulls to agent EOA | [`delegation/redeemer.ts`](packages/agent/src/delegation/redeemer.ts) |
| On-chain settlement | Uniswap Trading API quote + swap with Permit2 signatures | [`uniswap/trading.ts`](packages/agent/src/uniswap/trading.ts), [`uniswap/permit2.ts`](packages/agent/src/uniswap/permit2.ts) |
| Pre-trade allowance verification | On-chain caveat enforcer query before every pull | [`delegation/allowance.ts`](packages/agent/src/delegation/allowance.ts) |
| Audit report | ALLOWS / PREVENTS / WORST CASE / WARNINGS before execution starts | [`delegation/audit.ts`](packages/agent/src/delegation/audit.ts) |
| Auditable history | 125+ swaps executed, $5K+ traded, every tx on-chain | [Agent wallet](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xf13021F02E23a8113C1bD826575a1682F6Fac927) |

**Sponsor alignment:** MetaMask — "Best Use of Delegations", Uniswap — "Agentic Finance"

### Agents That Trust

*Reputation that no platform can revoke.*

Each intent gets an ERC-8004 identity NFT. Every swap is scored by the LLM judge pipeline (wallet-separated, on-chain self-feedback rejection enforced) across 3 dimensions, with content-addressed evidence hashed via keccak256. Those scores feed back into the agent's next reasoning cycle. The reputation lives on-chain, not in someone else's database.

**How Maw builds trust:**

| Capability | Implementation | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Portable identity | Per-intent ERC-8004 NFT on Base Sepolia, agentId persisted across restarts | [`identity/erc8004.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/erc8004.ts) |
| Composable reputation | Weighted composite scores (0-10) via `giveFeedback()` on Reputation Registry | [`identity/judge.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/judge.ts), [`identity/dimensions.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/dimensions.ts) |
| Self-improving feedback loop | Last 5 judge scores + reasoning injected into next cycle's LLM prompt | [`agent-loop/index.ts`](packages/agent/src/agent-loop/index.ts) — `formatFeedbackPrompt()` |
| Three-dimension validation | decision-quality (0.4), execution-quality (0.3), goal-progress (0.3) | [`identity/dimensions.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/dimensions.ts) |
| Content-addressed evidence | keccak256 hash on-chain matches hosted JSON — tampering detectable | [`identity/evidence.ts`](packages/agent/src/identity/evidence.ts) |
| Agent manifest | `agent.json` PAM spec with capabilities, tools, security policies | [`agent.json`](agent.json) |
| 8004scan integration | Dashboard links to 8004scan; identity.json follows scanner metadata format | [`routes/identity.ts`](packages/agent/src/routes/identity.ts), [8004scan](https://testnet.8004scan.io/agents/base-sepolia/2733) |
| Structured logs | Global + per-intent JSONL, downloadable via API, SSE streaming | [`logging/agent-log.ts`](packages/agent/src/logging/agent-log.ts), [`logging/intent-log.ts`](packages/agent/src/logging/intent-log.ts) |
